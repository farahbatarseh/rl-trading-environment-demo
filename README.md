# Reinforcement Learning Trading Environment (Demo)

Demo of a custom **Gym-style environment** for financial markets.

- Observation: OHLC data + technical features
- Action space: buy / sell / hold
- Reward: simple PnL-based shaping
- Episode management: max steps, equity stop, etc.

This repo is a simplified version of the environments I build for real TD3/SAC agents in trading projects. It is meant for **educational and portfolio purposes only**.
